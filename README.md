## Classic React toDo app 
This is my third task list ...
- First im made while watching tutorial
- next one im made myself - but im don't show this - believe me you don't want to see it ...
- And finally - third one! - yeah, not  so good how in tutorials. But it is my little child ...

### What im used here:
    - UseState - yeah good training for useState hook
    - map and filter - but you can use what you want
    - using a LocalStorage to save data in browser store
    - and catch some errors with try, catch    

### What this app can do:
    - add new task
    - delete task
    - edit task
    - and marks task on finished
    - and save data on reload page
