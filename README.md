## Classic React toDo app 
This is my third task list ...
- First I made while watching tutorial
- Next one I made myself - but I don't show this - believe me you don't want to see it ...
- And finally - third one! - yeah, not  so good how in tutorials. But it is my little child ...

### What I'm using here:
    - UseState - yeah good training for useState hook
    - Map and filter - but you can use what you want
    - Using a LocalStorage to save data in browser store
    - Catch some errors with try and catch    

### What this app can do:
    - adds new task
    - deletes task
    - edits task
    - marks finished task
    - Saves data on reload page
